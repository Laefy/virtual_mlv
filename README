This software is a very simple implementation of a virtual (single
stack) machine.

It has been developed at université de Marne la Vallée, by Sylvain
Lombardy. Afterwards, it has been modified by Nicolas Bedon and
Christophe Morvan. Gaël Fuhs has contributed a nice implementation of
a dynamic array, in order to remove the hard coded 100 label
limit. Further, Wuthy Hay has performed improvements on some
pieces of code (relative to dynamic arrays).

Currently this software is maintained by Christophe Morvan.
